# DownloadPage

_Provides instructions and download links for the Loom Client application._

## Overview
This component serves as the download page for the Loom Client. It automatically detects the user's operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux) and displays a primary download button tailored to their OS. It also provides alternative download links for other operating systems. The page is structured as a three-step guide, explaining how to download the client, define and package a job, and submit it to the network.

## Returns
A JSX element that renders the download page.

## Dependencies
- `react`
- `../components/MainSection`
- `../styles/download.css`
- `../styles/home.css`

## Notes
This guide is for users of the Download page. The Loom Client is a desktop application that allows you to define, package, and submit computational jobs to The Loom network. The page simplifies the download process by automatically detecting your operating system (OS) and presenting the most relevant download link. If you need to download the client for a different OS, alternative links are provided below the main button. The three-step guide on the page walks you through the entire process, from installation to submitting your first job.
